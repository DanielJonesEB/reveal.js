# Cloud Foundry Motivators

## Why Cloud Foundry? Why now?

## **Technology** is changing how business is done

note: Technology is being used in every facet of business. Users expect more.
Automation, AI, ChatOps, etc are affecting where, when and how work gets done.

---

## **Disruption** is inevitable

note: netflix/blockbuster story. Blockbuster was the leading video rental service & was disrupted by Netflix with streaming as the disruptive technology. Blockbuster even [had the chance to buy Netflix](http://uk.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7) in 2000 but dismissed it as a "very small niche business".

Andy Zitney, Allstate Insurance Company

* "The insurance industry **has not been disrupted** in 80+ years."
* "**Google** is in **40 states now**. 18 months ago, they weren't in any."
* "This industry is going to see an **Uber-like disruption** at a speed and pace that we can't react"

Having anticipated future disruption, based on extrapolating current trends, Andy Zitney & Allstate began to prepare for disruption

## "In the past, 90% of car value was in hardware. We expect 50% of the value in hardware and the other 50% divided by **software** and **experiences**."

Don Butler, Executive Director of Connected Vehicles, Ford

note: if users now value cars based on 50% software value, then Ford knew they had to make more and better software. They had to become a software business

## *Every* business is a **software business**

note: The automotive industry is not unique, rather *every* business will tend to be assessed similarly & must grow software delivery capability

## **superior experiences** can't be bought
# they are **built**

note: Off-the-shelf products on which companies can differentiate their businesses just don't exist. These companies are going to be building lots more software themselves. To save time, get a platform that allows you to focus on delivering just business software that adds value for your business, rather than building infrastructure on which to build that software

---

## Avoid lock-in

note: Platform lock-in is a bad thing, it reduces agility over time. We experienced it as an industry with various on-premise platforms e.g. WebSphere / WebLogic for Java Server, Oracle for RDBMS. AWS has promised much in the Cloud space however it can come with the price of lock-in to their Cloud offering

## "It's definitely around **speed to market**, but it's also about **getting it right** faster"

note: the pace of innovation is increasing

## maximize the effectiveness of your **organization** and **applications**

note: Whilst more products and services need to be delivered, budgets & head count may not increase. Don't waste resources doing things that don't differentiate your business.

---

## Disruptors are **leaner**

note: the disruptors in your market will be leaner than you. They wont have the historical infrastructure baggage, the legacy application code or the legacy process mindsets that come with longevity.

## "If software is eating the world, **cloud foundry** lets you become the **predator** instead of the prey."

Dr. Nic Williams, Stark &amp; Wayne

source: @drnic via Twitter

note: Cloud Foundry is *the* platform to address these issues. It is open-source, managed by a foundation rather than a single vendor, there are supported distributions if required. Cloud Foundry hides the infrastructure complexity so that you can focus on your value-adding business software
